Thoughts in spite of it all. This site is meant as a place to dump by thoughts. Neither quantity nor quality guaranteed.

I promise nothing beyond what already exists. The future may hold any, all, or none of the following:


    - Advice and thoughts on TTRPGs I run or design
    - Reviews on video games or TTRPGs I've played
    - Opinions on current tech ecosystems
    - Anything I feel like writing about
